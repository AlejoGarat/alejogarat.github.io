# Bachelor in Software Engineering

## About Me

I am a Computer Engineering student at Universidad ORT, currently in the final stages of completing my thesis titled "Analysis, Evaluation and Improvement of Active Regular Inference Algorithms for Neural Sequence Acceptors". Simultaneously, I hold the position of an Artificial Intelligence lecturer at the same university. With a keen interest in AI and Machine Learning, my goal is to apply my skills and knowledge to create innovative and impactful solutions for real-world problems. I consider myself hardworking and maintain a spirit of daily self-improvement, striving to enhance my capabilities consistently.

## Projects

### GraphRNNAutomaton

Utilized a GraphRNN architecture to generate Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) with specific properties.

### RAG Chatbot

The RAG Chatbot is an application that utilizes the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture to provide responses to user queries. The RAG architecture enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by augmenting their knowledge with additional contextual data. This chatbot is implemented using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. It leverages the LangChain library, which provides tools and utilities for natural language processing tasks. Specifically, it uses LangChain's Runnable interfaces to orchestrate the RAG architecture.

### Neural Checker

![image](./assets/img/neuralchecker.png)

Its main goal is to provide implementations for the structures needed for working in the Model Extraction Framework and enable the explainability and checking of complex systems in a black box context. It is developed by the Artificial Intelligence and Big Data team of Universidad ORT Uruguay.
